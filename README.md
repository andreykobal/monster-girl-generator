## ðŸš€ Game Concept

**Monster Speed Dating** is an AI-powered dating simulator game with a twist: the characters you meet are all unique, AI-generated monster girls! Youâ€™ll chat, flirt, and compete in various mini-games, all while using cutting-edge AI technology to drive the interactions.

The core gameplay loop involves:

- **Generate a Monster Girl**: Using a random image, we create an AI-powered character complete with a name, bio, and personality.
- **Speed Dating**: Youâ€™ll need to impress the character by chatting, answering questions, and participating in mini-games.
- **Game Over**: Did you succeed in winning her number? Or did you fail and meet a monstrous fate? Only time will tell!

## ðŸŽ® Game Features

- **AI-Powered Characters**: Each character is generated with a unique story and personality.
- **Speed Dating Mode**: Engage in quick interactions and try to impress your date before time runs out!
- **Multiple Endings**: Depending on your performance, the date can end in success or failure (or something worse... ðŸ˜±).
- **NFT Integration**: Mint your monster girl as an NFT once youâ€™ve impressed her!

## ðŸ§  AI Technology

This game is powered by AI to generate unique character cards, descriptions, and interactive dialogue. We use **OpenRouter API** to generate character descriptions, **Pinata** for storing assets, and a **smart contract** to mint the characters as NFTs. The AI handles the creativity for the bios, character interactions, and visual descriptions, ensuring each playthrough is different.


## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Generate Monster Girl**:  
   - You start the game by clicking on a button to generate a random monster girl.  
   - The game fetches an image and uses AI to generate detailed character information, including their name, age, race, profession, bio, and a roleplay starter message.

2. **Character Description**:  
   - Once the character is generated, the AI analyzes the image and provides a vivid description of the character's appearance and personality.  
   - This description is used to build a backstory and to provide context for the game.

3. **Start the Chat**:  
   - You are then introduced to the character through an initial message generated by the AI.  
   - The game enters a speed-dating scenario where you interact with the character in a text-based conversation.  
   - The AI creates dynamic responses and provides suggestions for what you can say next.

4. **Make Choices**:  
   - As the conversation progresses, you will be given different choices on how to respond, all driven by the AI.  
   - The character will react based on your responses, either positively or negatively, depending on your "technique," "charisma," and "emotional intelligence."

5. **Time Limit**:  
   - You have a limited time to impress the character (usually around 3 minutes).  
   - As the countdown ticks down, the AI tracks the quality of your conversation based on predefined metrics.

6. **Evaluation**:  
   - Once the timer runs out, the AI evaluates the conversation and provides feedback on how well you did.  
   - It calculates your score based on various factors like technique, charisma, creativity, and emotional intelligence.

7. **Game Over**:  
   - Based on your evaluation score, the game either ends in success (you win the characterâ€™s number) or failure (you "die" in a humorous, dramatic fashion).  
   - The AI provides a closing message, summarizing your performance and offering a chance to try again.

8. **NFT Minting (Optional)**:  
   - If you successfully impress the monster girl, you can mint her as an NFT.  
   - The character's data, including her image and bio, is stored on the blockchain, making her uniquely yours.


## ðŸ¤– AI Features

1. **Character Card Generation**:
   The character card is generated using AI with details like name, age, race, profession, bio, and first message. This is done by sending the image description to OpenRouter API.

   ```js
   const characterCard = await generateCharacterCard(imageDescription);
   ```

2. **Image Description**:
   AI analyzes the random image, providing a vivid, detailed description of the monster girl's features, race, and personality, which helps create a rich narrative.

   ```js
   const responseDescription = await axios.post(
     "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", 
     payloadDescription, { headers }
   );
   ```

3. **Chat Evaluation**:
   After the speed dating chat, AI evaluates the user's performance based on metrics like technique, charisma, creativity, and emotional intelligence. This feedback is structured in JSON format.

   ```js
   const evaluationMessage = { role: 'system', content: 'Evaluate the conversation...' };
   const evaluationResponse = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', { body: evaluationMessage });
   ```

4. **Roleplay Dialogue**:
   The characterâ€™s responses in the chat are powered by AI. It uses previous messages to generate engaging dialogues and offers suggestions for the playerâ€™s next move.

   ```js
   const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', { body: updatedMessages });
   const parsedMessage = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
   ```

5. **Character Background**:
   AI uses structured prompts to craft unique character backgrounds and scenarios. This ensures each encounter feels fresh and dynamic.

   ```js
   const systemMessage = { role: 'system', content: `You are ${characterData.name}, a...` };
   ```
